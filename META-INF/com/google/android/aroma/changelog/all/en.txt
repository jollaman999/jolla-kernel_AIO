- Applied Linux updates to Linux 4.4.165
- Fix suspend checks of sovc, dynamic fsync drivers
- Enable power saving technology that assign a task to a wake CPU by default.
- arp: Implement arp_project ARP Spoofing prevent technology
(It's a ARP Spoofing prevent technology that worked by graduate project to prevent gateway changing.
When using public Wi-Fi, it can prevent from attacking an external user by pretending to be a router.
The attacker can show all of Internet stream passing to a router when ARP spoofing attack is suceeded.
Depending on the ARP structure, it's hard to prevent attck when it is already proceeded by an attcker.
Search for ARP Spoofing attck.)
