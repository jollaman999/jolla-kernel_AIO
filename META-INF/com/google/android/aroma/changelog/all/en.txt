<b><#selectbg_g>[bullhead_II-v15.0]</#></b>
== Kernel ==
- Rebased!! (Super smooth and battery drain is nearly 0~1%!!)
- msm_thermal: Print message of vdd restriction
- msm8992: Disable vdd restriction
- msm_thermal: Rename some parameters
- msm_thermal: Control big cluster separately (More smooth.)
(Currently, when threshold temp is reached, both little and big will decrease frequency same time.
Add support to control big cluster separately.
So with this, it can start to decrease the frequency of big cluster in higher temperature.)
- msm_thermal: Fix explanation of prameters
- touchscreen, mdss: Fix touch wake functions not working after sound stopped
- touchscreen: synaptics: Do not try to turn off the touchscreen when screen turned on
- s2w: Fix wrong checks in s2w_input_event()
- mdss, touchscreen: Simplify touch on checks
- cpufreq: cpu-boost: Increase input_boost_ms to '1500'
(We disabled and tuned lots of things include 'msm_performance' and 40 is too short to keep higher frequncy.
Let's increase this value to keep higher frequncy while touching the screen.)
- tcp: enable sockets to use MSG_FASTOPEN by default
- ASoC: msm: qdsp6v2: Fix CVE-2016-2469 in Dolby (from CAF)
- ASoC: msm: qdsp6v2: Restore compliation of disabled modules
- crypto: sha256 - implement base layer for SHA-256
- crypto: sha512 - implement base layer for SHA-512
- crypto: arm64/sha2 - integrate OpenSSL implementations of SHA256/SHA512
- ANDROID: dm verity: add minimum prefetch size
(For device like eMMC, it gives better performance to read more hash blocks at a time.
For android, set it to default 128. saved boot-up time by 300ms in tested device)
- Applied some CAF patches from 'LineageOS/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996'
- Applied camera patches from CAF
- cpufreq: Add Relaxed governor
- Makefile: Add Linaro optimizations
- qcacld-2.0: Build with O3

== Kernel ==
>> Common <<
- mdss, sovc: Fix unbalanced mdss off
(The real problem was unbalanced mdss vreg(power) state.
It will try to turn off again after sound stopped.
So it will cause unbalanced state and device can't turn on the screen again.
Do not turn off mdss vreg when already turned off.)
- mdss, sovc: Do not turn off the mdss when it entered low power state
(There is a low power state in the mdss.
This mode is used when the device get an alarm and turn on the screen with black and white.
So it must be not turn off the mdss when it entered low power state.
Otherwise, it makes timeout error messages.)
- Revert "block: maple: Check display state when needed"
(This is useless commit.)
- Applied a sdcardfs related Android mnt change from Google android-3.10

- Input: xpad: Applied upstream changes
- ksm, msm_thermal, dt2w, s2w, sovc: Check low power state in fb notifier
(There is a low power state in the mdss.
This mode is used when the device get an alarm and turn on the screen with black and white.
If user enabled auto unlock screen feature, there will be a problem when mdss turn on the screen in low power state.
The driver will not go into the resume state.
So it must be check this low power state in fb notifier.)

- msm_thermal: Adjust thermal limit (Jan, 2017)

So, limit the big cluster further and only turn off the big cluster when the deivce is very hot.
It can also reduce the big cluster's on/off cycles and increase performance.)
- Add Adreno idler and enabled by default.
- adreno_idler: Add display state awareness
- msm_adreno_tz: Add display state awareness
- PM: devfreq: Applied some patches

~~~~~ Intoroduce new jolla-kernel_bullhead_II !! ~~~~~
- Rebuilt with lastest Google msm sources.
- Source cleanup.
- Greatly improved battery life and fix battery drain problems.
- Not applied Linux 3.10.y upstream patches.
  (It makes sense only apply some patches that we needed.)
- Replace UKSM to KSM.
- Applied some KSM upstream patches.
- Adjust default KSM values for save battery life.
- Correctly resume/suspend KSM
  (KSM is enabled by default. It will stop when screen turned off and working again when screen turned on.
   This can save battery life when device suspended.)
- Not applied EAS patches and use default sched with some patches.
  (Device working smoother without this and it shows better performance.
   Instead I applied scheduler and mm patches from franko kernel.)
- Replace f2fs's source to stable branch.
  (I used dev-test branch before but it shows errors and battery drain.
   No problems after changed to stable.)
- Touchscreen and display panel correctly turned off when music stopped when you using SOVC.
  (Before: Display panel remained in resume state and touchscrren not turned off coreectly in some cases.
   After: Now I fixed these issues and there is no more battery drain!!)
- Implement Auto Off Touchscreen for SOVC.
  (When you pressing the touchscreen for a long time touchscreen will turned off.
   It will prevent from wrong touchscreen working and lets you holding the device while walking.
   Default value is 4 seconds and you can change this value in aroma-installer.)
- Now, you can change the governor settings for big cores with msm_hotplug working!!
  (Finally, I figured out this annoying problem! Working well with Kernel Adiutor.
   It will turn on first of big core when you enter the cpu/governor settings in Kernel Adiutor.
   It will working normally again after 5 seconds when you exit from cpu/governor settings.)
- Remove suspend/resume works from touchscreen driver and use FB notifier for each drivers.
  (There was a huge suspend/resume works in touchscreen driver.
   Now suspend/resume works working separately in each drivers.)
- Improved suspend/resume works for Screen Off Volume Control, DoubleTap2Wake and Sweep2Wake.
- Fix race condition in cpu_up work.
