<b><#selectbg_g>[bullhead_II-v15.1]</#></b></@>
== Kernel ==
- Revert "netfilter: use jump_label for nf_hooks"
(This breaks tethering and some apps that use filtering when CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL is enabled.)
- netfilter: Applied some upstream patches
- arm64, jump label: Applied some upstream patches
- PCI: Fix lockdep warning

== Recovery ==
- jolla-kernel_bullhead_II-v15.1 applied

<b><#selectbg_g>[bullhead_II-v15.0]</#></b>
== Kernel ==
- Rebased!! (Super smooth and battery drain is nearly 0~1%!!)
- msm_thermal: Print message of vdd restriction
- msm8992: Disable vdd restriction
- msm_thermal: Rename some parameters
- msm_thermal: Control big cluster separately (More smooth.)
(Currently, when threshold temp is reached, both little and big will decrease frequency same time.
Add support to control big cluster separately.
So with this, it can start to decrease the frequency of big cluster in higher temperature.)
- msm_thermal: Fix explanation of prameters
- touchscreen, mdss: Fix touch wake functions not working after sound stopped
- touchscreen: synaptics: Do not try to turn off the touchscreen when screen turned on
- s2w: Fix wrong checks in s2w_input_event()
- mdss, touchscreen: Simplify touch on checks
- cpufreq: cpu-boost: Increase input_boost_ms to '1500'
(We disabled and tuned lots of things include 'msm_performance' and 40 is too short to keep higher frequncy.
Let's increase this value to keep higher frequncy while touching the screen.)
- tcp: enable sockets to use MSG_FASTOPEN by default
- ASoC: msm: qdsp6v2: Fix CVE-2016-2469 in Dolby (from CAF)
- ASoC: msm: qdsp6v2: Restore compliation of disabled modules
- crypto: sha256 - implement base layer for SHA-256
- crypto: sha512 - implement base layer for SHA-512
- crypto: arm64/sha2 - integrate OpenSSL implementations of SHA256/SHA512
- ANDROID: dm verity: add minimum prefetch size
(For device like eMMC, it gives better performance to read more hash blocks at a time.
For android, set it to default 128. saved boot-up time by 300ms in tested device)
- Applied some CAF patches from 'LineageOS/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996'
- Applied camera patches from CAF
- cpufreq: Add Relaxed governor
- Makefile: Add Linaro optimizations
- qcacld-2.0: Build with O3
- qcacld-2.0: Fix maybe-uninitialized warning messages
- ext4: Applied some upstream patches from 3.18.y
- Remove adredo-idler
- Remove per-process reclaim
- Remove old CAF patches

== AIO ==
- ramdisk: Remove 'input_boost_ms' line
(The default value is changed to 1500 by kernel.)
- ramdisk: Remove devfreq lines
- ramdisk: Remove per-process reclaim lines
- Remove Marshmallow support

== Recovery ==
- Built with new LineageOS sources
- Applied omni TWRP's recent patches
- recovery: Remove 'input_boost_ms' line
- recovery: Remove devfreq lines
- jolla-kernel_bullhead_II-v15.0 applied
