<b><#selectbg_g>[Gen2-v1.2, v17.2_Final]</#></b>
- LP/KK: smartmax: Added sampling_rate_screen_off parameter - Thanks to gu5t3r
(When screen on, smartmax will increase clock based on sampling_rate.
And when screen off, smartmax will increase clock slowly based on sampling_rate_screen_off.)
- LP: mm: Set VM_MAX_READAHEAD to 512

<b><#selectbg_g>[Gen2-v1.1, v17.1_Final]</#></b>
- dynamic_thermal_control: Prevent dynamic_thermal call when device is hot and go to ideal state
(When device is hot and go to ideal state 'dynamic_thermal' called and change the msm_thermal settings.
So the original max frequency get lower clock step by step when device is hot.
This patch fix this bug.)

This patch only applied for AOSP based Kikat & Lollipop kernel.

<b><#selectbg_g>[Gen2-v1.0]</#></b>
- No more update for Kitkat and Stock.
- Restart with Clean Code!!
(Rebuild with Google mako source. Applied latest Linux patches with some of fixes for joll-kernel directly. So all of sources and kernel performance are stable.)
- Applied patches from Linux 3.4.1 to 3.4.105 one by one. (So sources and performance are stable.)
- Dynamic Thermal Control: Automatically adjust throttling settings when CPU clock changed. (Own making!!)
(Solve the existing problem coming back to 1134Mhz despite you change the CPU clock!!)
- Greatly improved battery life due to the source stabilization. (Light user can be used up to a day or more to use.)

- doubletap2wake: You can wake your device by 10 taps in a second!! (Configurable tap counts!!)
  0 : Off
  1~9 : Wake by n+1 taps. (n = Your setting)

  Example)
  0 : Doubletap2wake will not working.
  1 : Wake by double taps.
  2 : Wake by triple taps.
  9 : Wake by 10 taps.

  Recognizing Time : 100ms * 'touch counts'
  (So when you set to 9, you can wake your device by 10 taps in 1 second. :p)

<b><#selectbg_g>[v10]</#></b>

- Stock Camera ported.
- Random hot reboot fixed. (When you flashing and booting first time, or when you using, there was random hot reboot. I found the error in binder which is connection between Android and Kernel. So I compared with Gproj kernel source and fixed it. Also, you can use ART runtime without random hot reboot as well.)
- Minimum clock increased. (81MHz -> 270MHz) (There was kernel crash with some of devices. So increased it.)
- Back to intelli-plug driver from MSM_HOTPLUG driver. (I think intelli-plug is better for battery life.)
- Throttling temperature limit decreased. And fixed bug that clock can't back to 1134MHz. (I think maximum temperature is high. So decreased it. And when throttling began, it has locked into 1026MHz. So fixed it.)
- 384Mhz L2 Cache voltage optimized. And fixed one of missed structure valuable.
- Android Logger (logcat) optimized and deactivated it. (Don't use it commonly.)

<b><#selectbg_g>[v9_Refresh]</#></b>

- Kernel stability : Fix some of conflicts in the source while patching Linux 3.4.103.
- mod/normal kernel both support.
- User can personalize throttling options. (You can personalize temperature and clock per level with Trickster Mod app.)
(※ You can use temperature limit option with Trickster Mod app, 'Temperature control'.)

<b><#selectbg_g>[v9]</#></b>

- Deleted intelli-plug for compatibility and added MSM_Hotplug driver for better hot-plugging.
- Deleted unused USB network driver.
- ARM RWSEM, AES, SHA1 algorithm optimization
- Optimization for ARM CPUs. (Allow CPU-supported unaligned acesses, Manage only online CPUs.)
- Android logcat buffer size decreased. (256 -> 128)
- Voltage and clock value changed for kernel stability.
- Intellidemand cpu governer updated to ver 5.0 and deleted Slim governer which is simillar with Intellidemand.
- Smartmax governer's suspend_ideal_freq increased. (594000 -> 702000)
- I/O performance increased and buffer reading size increased. (128 -> 512)
- Modified L2 cache size to increase overall kernel performance.
- Using noatime, nodirtime for default mount options. It gives I/O performance increasing.
- writeback, sched, SElinux optimization.
- FAUX sound updated to v3.5
- F2FS : Updated based on Linux 3.16.1.
- Deleted unused parts of Knock on's Swipe to Wake.
