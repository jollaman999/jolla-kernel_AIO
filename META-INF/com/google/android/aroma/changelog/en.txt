<b><#selectbg_g>[bullhead_II-v25.0]</#></b>

- Appiled Google's July patches and Android O DP3 patches
- Linux 3.10.107
- xpad: Applied lastest Linux upstream patches
- kms: Applied lastest Linux upstream patches
- net, mm, sdcardfs: Applied lastest patches from Google android-3.10
- msm_thermal: Adjust for more smooth performance with lower temperature!
- msm_thermal: Implement throttling delay
(Frequency will not be limited immediately.
 It will be limited to lower index after some delay.
 Also, release the limit and reset the delay when the temperature drops.
 So, it will guarantee of performance during this time. Default is 4 seconds.)
- msm_thermal: Implement Little's core control
(Performance and temerature is better with turn off some Little cores
while give higher frequencies to remained Little cores.)
- qcacld-2.0(wlan driver): Update to LA.BF64.1.2.3_rb1.14 (from CAF)
