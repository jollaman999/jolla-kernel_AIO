== Kernel ==
- Seperate N and O kernels.

>> N <<
- Reverted Android O commits and only appiled nanohub and ipv6 related patches.
(Android O commits reduce the performance of the device.)

>> O <<
- Cleanup Android O commits.

>> Common <<
- arp: Add 'ignore_proxy_arp' option and enable it by default
(There is no need to use proxy ARP in mobile devices.
Also it is safe to ignore these packets.)
- arp: Remove gateway update detection in proxy ARP
(It makes no sense to check gateway update in proxy ARP.
Because with proxy ARP, it will not use gateway IP address to forward traffics.)
- arp: Check ARP request to gateway and detect attacker's hw address
- arp: arp_project: Version up to v1.0
- ANDROID: hid: uhid: implement refcount for open and close (from Google android-3.10)
- msm: kgsl: Add accounting for memory mapped in userspace
(It was missed while merging Nougat's mr2 patches.)
- Applied some CAF's security related patches.

== AIO ==
- f2fs-tools: Applied lastest changes of dev branch.
- Separate N and O kernel images.

== Recovery ==
- f2fs-tools: Applied lastest changes of dev branch.
- Built with lastest LineageOS sources
- Appiled jolla-kernel_bullhead_II-v22.2

<b><#selectbg_g>[bullhead_II-v22.1]</#></b>
== Kernel ==
- misc: fpc1020: Set fingerprintd priority to max when screen is off (by sultanxda)
- cpufreq: Introduce fingerprint boost driver (by frap129 origin codes by sultanxda)
- + Minor fixes for fingerprint boost driver

== AIO ==
- Updater: Check the error of executing su command (Fix force close when SU is not allowed for updater.)
- Updater: Cleanup unused usages
- Updater: Show toast messages for a long time
- Updater: Version up to v1.9

== Recovery ==
- Appiled jolla-kernel_bullhead_II-v22.1

<b><#selectbg_g>[bullhead_II-v22.0]</#></b>
== Kernel ==
- Appiled Android O DP2 patches
- f2fs: Add missed 'bio_put(bio)' in 'f2fs_submit_discard_endio()'
- nanohub: Applied lastest marlin patches and Android O DP2 patch from Google msm
- kernel: Only expose su when daemon is running (from LineageOS android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996)
- kernel: Fix potential refcount leak in su check (from LineageOS android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996)
- sdcardfs: Applied lastest android-3.10 patches from Google android-3.10
- net/packet: Fix overflow patches from Google android-3.10
- msm_thermal: Check high temp and decrease LITTLE's frequency to lower values
( When big core is turned off, LITTLE's decrease step will set to 2
by 'temp_count_max_little_with_big_off'.
 In some cases, when device is too hot, there is no way to decrease frequency.
 It needs to check high temp to get lower frequencies of LITTLE cores.)
- arm/arm64: Applies some complie related patches from Google android-3.10

== AIO ==
- Updater: Update libraries to O
- Updater: Main: Do not call 'getApplicationContext()' when not needed
