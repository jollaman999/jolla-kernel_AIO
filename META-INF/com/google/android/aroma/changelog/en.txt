~~~~~ Intoroduce new jolla-kernel_bullhead_II !! ~~~~~
- Rebuilt with lastest Google msm sources.
- Source cleanup.
- Greatly improved battery life and fix battery drain problems.
- Not applied Linux 3.10.y upstream patches.
  (It makes sense only apply some patches that we needed.)
- Replace UKSM to KSM.
- Applied some KSM upstream patches.
- Adjust default KSM values for save battery life.
- Correctly resume/suspend KSM
  (KSM is enabled by default. It will stop when screen turned off and working again when screen turned on.
   This can save battery life when device suspended.)
- Not applied EAS patches and use default sched with some patches.
  (Device working smoother without this and it shows better performance.
   Instead I applied scheduler and mm patches from franko kernel.)
- Replace f2fs's source to stable branch.
  (I used dev-test branch before but it shows errors and battery drain.
   No problems after changed to stable.)
- Touchscreen and display panel correctly turned off when music stopped when you using SOVC.
  (Before: Display panel remained in resume state and touchscrren not turned off coreectly in some cases.
   After: Now I fixed these issues and there is no more battery drain!!)
- Implement Auto Off Touchscreen for SOVC.
  (When you pressing the touchscreen for a long time touchscreen will turned off.
   It will prevent from wrong touchscreen working and lets you holding the device while walking.
   Default value is 4 seconds and you can change this value in aroma-installer.)
- Now, you can change the governor settings for big cores with msm_hotplug working!!
  (Finally, I figured out this annoying problem! Working well with Kernel Adiutor.
   It will turn on first of big core when you enter the cpu/governor settings in Kernel Adiutor.
   It will working normally again after 5 seconds when you exit from cpu/governor settings.)
- Remove suspend/resume works from touchscreen driver and use FB notifier for each drivers.
  (There was a huge suspend/resume works in touchscreen driver.
   Now suspend/resume works working separately in each drivers.)
- Improved suspend/resume works for Screen Off Volume Control, DoubleTap2Wake and Sweep2Wake.
- Fix race condition in cpu_up work.
