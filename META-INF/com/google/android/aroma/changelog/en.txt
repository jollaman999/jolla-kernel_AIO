>> Common <<
- mdss, sovc: Fix unbalanced mdss off
(The real problem was unbalanced mdss vreg(power) state.
It will try to turn off again after sound stopped.
So it will cause unbalanced state and device can't turn on the screen again.
Do not turn off mdss vreg when already turned off.)
- mdss, sovc: Do not turn off the mdss when it entered low power state
(There is a low power state in the mdss.
This mode is used when the device get an alarm and turn on the screen with black and white.
So it must be not turn off the mdss when it entered low power state.
Otherwise, it makes timeout error messages.)
- Revert "block: maple: Check display state when needed"
(This is useless commit.)
- Applied a sdcardfs related Android mnt change from Google android-3.10
- android: binder: Applied Google's hwbinder branch changes
- net: Applied Google's hwbinder branch changes
- sound: msm, soc: optimize for size
- lib/vsprintf.c: Applied upstream changes
- Input: xpad: Applied upstream changes
- ksm, msm_thermal, dt2w, s2w, sovc: Check low power state in fb notifier
(There is a low power state in the mdss.
This mode is used when the device get an alarm and turn on the screen with black and white.
If user enabled auto unlock screen feature, there will be a problem when mdss turn on the screen in low power state.
The driver will not go into the resume state.
So it must be check this low power state in fb notifier.)
