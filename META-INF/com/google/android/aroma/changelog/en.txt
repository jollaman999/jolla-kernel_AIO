<b><#selectbg_g>[joan-v2.2]</#></b></@>
== Kernel ==
>> Oreo <<
- Applied Linux patches: 4.4.167, 4.4.168
- Applied recent Qualcomm msm-4.4 patches
- Applied recent Qualcomm WLAN patches

== Recovery ==
- Use jolla_kernel_joan_v2.2


<b><#selectbg_g>[joan-v2.1]</#></b>
== Kernel ==
>> Oreo <<
- Optimized for game performance
  - msm: kgsl: Mark IRQ and worker thread as performance critical
  - msm: kgsl: Let user to select enable kgsl power control limit
  (Enable/Disable GPU thermal limit. Very smooth game performance when it is disabled.
  But the device gets hotter.)
  - cpu_input_boost, kgsl: Boost CPU and devfreq when GPU frequency is reached to 342Mhz

== Recovery ==
- Use jolla_kernel_joan_v2.1


<b><#selectbg_g>[joan-v2.0]</#></b>
== Kernel ==
>> Oreo <<
- Adjusted for battery and performance.
  - cpu_input_boost: Remove big cluster minimum frequency option
  - cpu_input_boost: Remove little cluster minimum frequency option
  - Disable LGE hswap function (lowmemory killer reclaim with zram)
  - lowmemory killer: Disable adaptive LMK
  - lowmemory killer: Add ANDROID_LMK_ADJ_RBTREE function
  - Revert "msm: mdss: Boost cpubw devfreq device when a new frame is ready"
  - Revert "msm: mdss: Boost CPU when a new frame is ready to be committed"
  - Adjust input boost values refer to stock
- Applied Linux updates to Linux 4.4.166
- Fix msm8998 device tree for joan 21o version sound
- ASoC: msm: qdsp6v2: Add LGE DTS support from V40 kernel source
- Back to CFQ io scheduler (fastest in UX performance)

== Recovery ==
- Use jolla_kernel_joan_v2.0


<b><#selectbg_g>[joan-v1.2]</#></b>
== Kernel ==
>> Oreo <<
- Applied Linux updates to Linux 4.4.165
- Fix suspend checks of sovc, dynamic fsync drivers
- Enable power saving technology that assign a task to a wake CPU by default.
- arp: Implement arp_project ARP Spoofing prevent technology
(It's a ARP Spoofing prevent technology that worked by graduate project to prevent gateway changing.
When using public Wi-Fi, it can prevent from attacking an external user by pretending to be a router.
The attacker can show all of Internet stream passing to a router when ARP spoofing attack is suceeded.
Depending on the ARP structure, it's hard to prevent attck when it is already proceeded by an attcker.
Search for ARP Spoofing attck.)

== Recovery ==
- Use jolla_kernel_joan_v1.2
